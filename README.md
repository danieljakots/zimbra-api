This is script is a little Proof of Concept, I wanted to fetch the
data from zimbra REST API. You can find the API doc
[there](https://wiki.zimbra.com/wiki/Zimbra_REST_API_Reference).
I didn't find much how to do it, that's why I'm publishing this
script. This is not the dev repository so don't expect a nice commit log.

The comments are in French because they're intended for my coworkers
and their mother tongue is French, but I'm sure you'll be able to
understand what is happening :)
